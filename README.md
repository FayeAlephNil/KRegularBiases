# Code for "Biases among Congruence Classes for Parts in k-regular Partitions"

Authors: Faye Jackson, Misheel Otgonbayar

This code accompanies a paper by the authors above concerning Biases among Congruence Classes for Parts in k-regular partitons.

## Usage

- Find-N.nb is used to find N\_k(t) within the paper, specifically it allows one to minimize N\_(t,delta) over the possible delta which are allowed.
- Finite-check.nb is used to perform the finite checks of the inequality D\_k(r,t;n) >= D\_k(r+1,t;n) at the end of the paper.
